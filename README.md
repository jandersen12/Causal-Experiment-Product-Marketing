# A Causal Experimental Study on Product Bundling and Personalization

### Motivation

In digital commerce, personalization and product bundling are widely used strategies aimed at increasing
consumer engagement and spending. This study investigates whether identity-based personalization enhances
the effectiveness of product bundling in driving purchase behavior. 

### Tools

R | Qualtrics 

### Structure and Hypothesis

Using a 3x2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 272 US-based participants into one of 6 purchase environment conditions, varying in personalization and bundling. We hypothesized that both personalization and bundling would independently increase total spending and that their combination would also produce a positive effect on spending.

### Results

Contrary to expectations, we found no statistically significant differences in total purchase amounts across any of the treatment conditions. The findings contribute to the need for more nuanced understanding of the contextual and psychological factors that shape the effectiveness of digital marketing strategies.


### Key Learnings

Conducting this experiment introduced me to the challenges of designing a study that would capture the necessary data in a limited amount of time. There were limitations to our study, including a limited sample size and a simulated purchasing environment, which measures intent to purchase rather than actual purchase amounts. However, the study provided valuable experience in experimental design, execution, recruitment, and rigorous statistical analysis.
